SWEN - 250 Activity Reflection:
Name: Muhammad Yousaf Iqbal
Start:
Estimated Time:	01 00 - 02 00
Plan: (Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Implement the funciton as per assignment and follow steps, Testing the function every section, and fixing any errors on compile, slowly implement the function, and troubleshoot as going along.
Complete:
Actual Time: 02 00 - 04 00
Observations: (Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Seg fault error, was stuck, but got help via discord and eventually solved the issue, had to rework the function and change the way I ran the function on the command line, compile errors as usual but got those fixed, etc. The seg fault was a major obstacle and I thankfully got it fixed.
Note For Grader: (Dan), you said "ritwc.c = 1/15 - ritwc.c compiles but seg faults due to file calls. Use getchar() to read from stdin", however this is false. When I ran wc < DarkAndStormyNight.txt and/or ./ritwc DarkAndStormyNight.txt , I got the correct output as per assignment. I think you are running the function wrong and using ./ritwc < DarkAndStormyNight.txt which does result in seg fault, but the function works and I should have gotten a way better grade than 1/15 (atleast 12 or so), makes no sense.
