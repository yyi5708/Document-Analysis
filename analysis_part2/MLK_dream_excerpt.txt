I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia
 the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave
 owners will be able to sit down together at the table
 of brotherhood.

I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,
 a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,
 sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be
 transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.

I have a dream that my four little children will one day
 live in a nation where they will not be judged by
 the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

I have a dream today.
