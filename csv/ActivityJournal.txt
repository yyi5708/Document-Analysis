SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	04 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Implement all functions as per instruction, test each function frequently, fixing any compile errors, and making sure the unit tests past, etc.

Complete
Actual Time	02 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
Had issues with the code and there were compile errors with some of the function because of unused variables, forgetting ";". etc. Simple mistakes, but the functions were also not passing and only half of tests passed, it was not reading the file right and was including [], and not reading right like the new line thing, I had to refix the function, and the issues was i was using [i += 1] which would result in all the tests not passing, but I changed it to [i ++] and now they all passed, I dont know why tho because those 2 are the same operations, but that was the main problem. All tests passed.

================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	02 00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
Run the functions I created from the command line via the run lines provided in the assignment, make sure everything matches up and the output is correct and matches as expected.

Complete
Actual Time	01 00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
When I ran the commands, nothing happended, I thought maybe I did something wrong or what, but nothing was working. I asked via discord and got help as to there would be nothing returning on the line, rather in the file, there would be some changes made, and yes that I saw it did work. Just a slight problem, but now I get it.

Continuous Integration With Gitlab (CI)

Output: Status, passed, 00:00:22, 6 minutes ago. Pipeline, Update .gitlab-ci.yml file, #138720, main, 3ee5e030, Muhammad Y. Iqbal (RIT Student), latest.

Note: So i think i messed my repo up because git was saying something about fetch, pull, merge, etc. and I dont know if everything is fixed now? I mean all my files are being pushed to GitLab and I see it there, but I dont know if I messed anything else up. It all started when I did the CI thing in the assigment and did the CI/CD config, I copy and pasted the file into the editor and it says it passed, so im guessing its right?
